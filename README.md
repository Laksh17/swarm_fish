THIS PROJECT IS A PART OF AN INTERNSHIP FROM DASSUALT SYSTEMS ABOUT SHRIMP FARMING USING ROBOTIC FISHES

ABOUT:
This project aims to build a GUI for demonstarting the traversal and obstacle detecting functions conducted by robotic fishes in a pool filled with organisms to be cultivated (like shrimps in this case). It is built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.
